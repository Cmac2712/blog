# Blog ðŸ“–

This is my blog.

Built with Astro Starter Kit: https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/

## Deployment

Push commits to the main branch. Will be deployed to Vercel ðŸš€

## Adding Blog Posts

Blog posts are added via Obsidian: [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)

Posts are synced to another repo using the Obsidian git plugin: [publish.obsidian.md/git-doc](https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/01+Start+here)

The other repo can be found here: [ github.com/Cmac2712/blog-posts ]( https://github.com/Cmac2712/blog-posts )

...which contains the [GitHub workflow](https://github.com/Cmac2712/blog-posts/blob/main/.github/workflows/blog-posts-import.yml) for syncing the blog posts to this repo so they can be deployed to our Astro site.
